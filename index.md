Hello my name is [Mark](mailto:markabonicillo@gmail.com). 

I'm a Seattle native, born and raised in the Lake City and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. I'm also a former Marine who's returned back to Seattle after six years on the East coast or overseas. 

I like to box, Crossfit, and swim. 
My hobbies include the piano, jazz, and reading non-fiction books in science, tech, psychology, and behavioral economics. 
Currently, my favorite writer is [Cheryl Strayed](http://www.cherylstrayed.com/tiny_beautiful_things_114549.htm){:target="_blank"}.
