Hello my name is [Mark](mailto:mark@markbonicillo.com). 

I'm a former Marine turned MBA turned Software Engineer in Seattle. I like to swim and lift. 
My hobbies include playing the piano, listening to jazz, and reading non-fiction books in science, tech, psychology, and behavioral economics. 
Currently, my favorite writer is [Cheryl Strayed](http://www.cherylstrayed.com/tiny_beautiful_things_114549.htm).

I'm also a Seattle native. I work at a [bookstore](https://www.amazon.com)
