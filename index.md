Hello my name is Mark. 

I'm a former Marine turned MBA turned Software Engineer in Seattle. 
I like to swim and lift. My hobbies include playing the piano, listening to jazz, and 
reading non-fiction books in the science, tech, psychology, and behavioral economics geners. 
Currently, my favorite writer is [Cheryl Strayed](http://www.cherylstrayed.com/tiny_beautiful_things_114549.htm)

I'm also a Seattle native. I work at a [bookstore](https://www.amazon.com)
