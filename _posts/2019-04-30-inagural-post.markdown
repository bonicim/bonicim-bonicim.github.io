Finally. I have been meaning to migrate my personal website from React to Jekyll. And it's done. It wasn't too hard. I just needed to make time for this migration. In keeping with my minimalist style, my personal website is mostly text, ad-free, and has minimal images and video cliips. 

My personal website is a collection of my blog posts about the liberal arts, politics, business, and tech; stuff I'm reading; stuff I've published; and of course, anything jazz related.
